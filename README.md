# Dynamic Loan Offer Generation System

A sophisticated microservices-based system designed to generate and rank personalized loan offers based on user risk profiles, behavior metrics, and business rules.

## 🚀 Features

- Dynamic loan offer generation with real-time risk assessment
- User behavior analysis for personalized offers
- Intelligent offer optimization and ranking
- High-performance caching and data management
- Scalable microservices architecture
- Comprehensive monitoring and metrics

## 🏗 Architecture

The system follows a microservices architecture with the following core components:

- **API Gateway**: Entry point for all external requests
- **Offer Generation Service**: Orchestrates the offer generation process
- **Risk Assessment Service**: Calculates risk scores and ROI ranges
- **User Behavior Service**: Analyzes user behavior patterns
- **Offer Optimization Service**: Optimizes and ranks loan offers
- **Data Service**: Manages data access and persistence
